[DEABOY] I made two lists in the Censor.java class. One is for blocked words, the other is
			for strictly blocked words. The difference is this: words on the blocked list
			must fully match the words on the message. In other words, if "pickles" is blocked,
			then "pickleman" won't be blocked, but "pick le" will. Or even "P1ckl3". But if
			pickle was on the blockedStrict list, then it would be blocked ANYWHERE it is
			found. It would be blocked in each of these cases: "somepic kle", "Piiiiiickkkkleeee",
			"picklesandwhich", "ilikepickles" and even "p11i1i1ickkkklll111ll__ee33e33".

[DEABOY] I'd like the "hasPermission(string/permission)" functions removed from permission classes; it's unnecessary, since we already have "hasPermisison(string/permission, inherited)" functions. It will make the code cleaner.

[DEABOY] When checking permissions for users or groups, the functions used no longer automatically create the permission, but rather check to see if it already exists. It is the responsibility of the class checking for the permission to register the permission ahead of time and to retain at least a pointer to said permission.
